The Online Books Page has an FAQ\nwhich gives a summary of copyright durations for many\nother countries, as well as links to more official sources.\nThis PDF ebook was\ncreated by José Menéndez.\n\nTRUE!—nervous—very, very dreadfully nervous I had been\nand am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease\nhad sharpened my senses—not destroyed—not dulled them.\nAbove all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in\nthe heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell.\nHow, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how\nhealthily—how calmly I can tell you the whole story.\nIt is impossible to say how first the idea entered my\nbrain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night.\nObject there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the\nold man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me\ninsult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye!\nyes, it was this! One of his eyes resembled that of a\nvulture—a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell\nupon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees—very\ngradually—I made up my mind to take the life of the old\nman, and thus rid myself of the eye for ever.\nNow this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen\nknow nothing. But you should have seen me. You should\nhave seen how wisely I proceeded—with what caution—\nwith what foresight—with what dissimulation I went to\nwork! I was never kinder to the old man than during the\nwhole week before I killed him. And every night, about\nmidnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it—oh, so\ngently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for\nmy head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, so that no\nlight shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would\nhave laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it\nslowly—very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old\nman’s sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head\nwithin the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon\n3\n\n4 THE TELL-TALE HEART\nhis bed. Ha!—would a madman have been so wise as this?\nAnd then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the\nlantern cautiously—oh, so cautiously—cautiously (for the\nhinges creaked)—I undid it just so much that a single thin\nray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long\nnights—every night just at midnight—but I found the eye\nalways closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it\nwas not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And\nevery morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the\nchamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by\nname in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he had passed the\nnight. So you see he would have been a very profound old\nman, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I\nlooked in upon him while he slept.\nUpon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious\nin opening the door. A watch’s minute hand moves more\nquickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the\nextent of my own powers—of my sagacity. I could scarcely\ncontain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was,\nopening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of\nmy secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea;\nand perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly,\nas if startled. Now you may think that I drew back—but no.\nHis room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness (for\nthe shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers),\nand so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door,\nand I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.\nI had my head in, and was about to open the lantern,\nwhen my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old\nman sprang up in the bed, crying out—“Who’s there?”\nI kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I\ndid not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear\nhim lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening;—\n\nEDGAR ALLAN POE 5\njust as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death\nwatches in the wall.\nPresently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the\ngroan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of\ngrief—oh, no!—it was the low stifled sound that arises from\nthe bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew\nthe sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the\nworld slept, it has welled up from my own bosom,\ndeepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted\nme. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and\npitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had\nbeen lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he\nhad turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing\nupon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but\ncould not. He had been saying to himself—“It is nothing but\nthe wind in the chimney—it is only a mouse crossing the\nfloor,” or “it is merely a cricket which has made a single\nchirp.” Yes, he has been trying to comfort himself with these\nsuppositions; but he had found all in vain. All in vain;\nbecause Death, in approaching him, had stalked with his\nblack shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it\nwas the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that\ncaused him to feel—although he neither saw nor heard—to\nfeel the presence of my head within the room.\nWhen I had waited a long time, very patiently, without\nhearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little—a very,\nvery little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it—you cannot\nimagine how stealthily, stealthily—until, at length, a single\ndim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the\ncrevice and full upon the vulture eye.\nIt was open—wide, wide open—and I grew furious as I\ngazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness—all a dull\nblue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow\nin my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man’s\n\n6 THE TELL-TALE HEART\nface or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct,\nprecisely upon the damned spot.\nAnd now have I not told you that what you mistake for\nmadness is but over-acuteness of the senses?—now, I say,\nthere came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a\nwatch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound\nwell too. It was the beating of the old man’s heart. It\nincreased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the\nsoldier into courage.\nBut even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely\nbreathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I\ncould maintain the ray upon the eye. Meantime the hellish\ntattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker,\nand louder and louder every instant. The old man’s terror\nmust have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every\nmoment!—do you mark me well? I have told you that I am\nnervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night,\namid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a\nnoise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for\nsome minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the\nbeating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst.\nAnd now a new anxiety seized me—the sound would be\nheard by a neighbor! The old man’s hour had come! With a\nloud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room.\nHe shrieked once—once only. In an instant I dragged him to\nthe floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled\ngaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes,\nthe heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did\nnot vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length\nit ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and\nexamined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed\nmy hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes.\nThere was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would\ntrouble me no more.\n\nEDGAR ALLAN POE 7\nIf still you think me mad, you will think so no longer\nwhen I describe the wise precautions I took for the\nconcealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked\nhastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I\ncut off the head and the arms and the legs.\nI then took up three planks from the flooring of the\nchamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then\nreplaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human\neye—not even his—could have detected any thing wrong.\nThere was nothing to wash out—no stain of any kind—no\nblood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had\ncaught all—ha! ha!\nWhen I had made an end of these labors, it was four\no’clock—still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the\nhour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down\nto open it with a light heart,—for what had I now to fear?\nThere entered three men, who introduced themselves, with\nperfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been\nheard by a neighbor during the night; suspicion of foul play\nhad been aroused; information had been lodged at the police\noffice, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the\npremises.\nI smiled,—for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen\nwelcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The\nold man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my\nvisitors all over the house. I bade them search—search well.\nI led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his\ntreasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my\nconfidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them\nhere to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild\naudacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the\nvery spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.\nThe officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced\nthem. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I\n\n8 THE TELL-TALE HEART\nanswered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But, ere\nlong, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My\nhead ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they\nsat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct:—it\ncontinued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to\nget rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained\ndefinitiveness—until, at length, I found that the noise was\nnot within my ears.\nNo doubt I now grew very pale;—but I talked more\nfluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound\nincreased—and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick\nsound—much such a sound as a watch makes when\nenveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath—and yet the officers\nheard it not. I talked more quickly—more vehemently; but\nthe noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles,\nin a high key and with violent gesticulations, but the noise\nsteadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the\nfloor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by\nthe observation of the men—but the noise steadily increased.\nOh God! what could I do? I foamed—I raved—I swore! I\nswung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it\nupon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually\nincreased. It grew louder—louder—louder! And still the\nmen chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they\nheard not? Almighty God!—no, no! They heard!—they\nsuspected!—they knew!—they were making a mockery of\nmy horror!—this I thought, and this I think. But any thing\nwas better than this agony! Any thing was more tolerable\nthan this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no\nlonger! I felt that I must scream or die!—and now—again!—\nhark! louder! louder! louder! louder!—\n“Villains!” I shrieked, “dissemble no more! I admit the\ndeed!—tear up the planks!—here, here!—it is the beating of\nhis hideous heart!”",

Whenever it fell\nupon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees—very\ngradually—I made up my mind to take the life of the old\nman, and thus rid myself of the eye for ever.\nNow this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen\nknow nothing. But you should have seen me. You should\nhave seen how wisely I proceeded—with what caution—\nwith what foresight—with what dissimulation I went to\nwork! I was never kinder to the old man than during the\nwhole week before I killed him. And every night, about\nmidnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it—oh, so\ngently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for\nmy head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, so that no\nlight shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would\nhave laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it\nslowly—very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old\nman’s sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head\nwithin the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon\n3\n\n4 THE TELL-TALE HEART\nhis bed. Ha!—would a madman have been so wise as this?\nAnd then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the\nlantern cautiously—oh, so cautiously—cautiously (for the\nhinges creaked)—I undid it just so much that a single thin\nray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long\nnights—every night just at midnight—but I found the eye\nalways closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it\nwas not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And\nevery morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the\nchamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by\nname in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he had passed the\nnight. So you see he would have been a very profound old\nman, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I\nlooked in upon him while he slept.\nUpon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious\nin opening the door. A watch’s minute hand moves more\nquickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the\nextent of my own powers—of my sagacity. I could scarcely\ncontain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was,\nopening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of\nmy secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea;\nand perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly,\nas if startled. Now you may think that I drew back—but no.\nHis room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness (for\nthe shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers),\nand so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door,\nand I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.\nI had my head in, and was about to open the lantern,\nwhen my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old\nman sprang up in the bed, crying out—“Who’s there?”\nI kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I\ndid not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear\nhim lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening;—\n\nEDGAR ALLAN POE 5\njust as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death\nwatches in the wall.\nPresently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the\ngroan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of\ngrief—oh, no!—it was the low stifled sound that arises from\nthe bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew\nthe sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the\nworld slept, it has welled up from my own bosom,\ndeepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted\nme. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and\npitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had\nbeen lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he\nhad turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing\nupon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but\ncould not. He had been saying to himself—“It is nothing but\nthe wind in the chimney—it is only a mouse crossing the\nfloor,” or “it is merely a cricket which has made a single\nchirp.” Yes, he has been trying to comfort himself with these\nsuppositions; but he had found all in vain. All in vain;\nbecause Death, in approaching him, had stalked with his\nblack shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it\nwas the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that\ncaused him to feel—although he neither saw nor heard—to\nfeel the presence of my head within the room.\nWhen I had waited a long time, very patiently, without\nhearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little—a very,\nvery little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it—you cannot\nimagine how stealthily, stealthily—until, at length, a single\ndim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the\ncrevice and full upon the vulture eye.\nIt was open—wide, wide open—and I grew furious as I\ngazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness—all a dull\nblue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow\nin my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man’s\n\n6 THE TELL-TALE HEART\nface or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct,\nprecisely upon the damned spot.\nAnd now have I not told you that what you mistake for\nmadness is but over-acuteness of the senses?—now, I say,\nthere came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a\nwatch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound\nwell too. It was the beating of the old man’s heart. It\nincreased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the\nsoldier into courage.\nBut even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely\nbreathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I\ncould maintain the ray upon the eye. Meantime the hellish\ntattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker,\nand louder and louder every instant. The old man’s terror\nmust have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every\nmoment!—do you mark me well? I have told you that I am\nnervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night,\namid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a\nnoise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for\nsome minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the\nbeating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst.\nAnd now a new anxiety seized me—the sound would be\nheard by a neighbor! The old man’s hour had come! With a\nloud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room.\nHe shrieked once—once only. In an instant I dragged him to\nthe floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled\ngaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes,\nthe heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did\nnot vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length\nit ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and\nexamined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed\nmy hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes.\nThere was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would\ntrouble me no more.\n\nEDGAR ALLAN POE 7\nIf still you think me mad, you will think so no longer\nwhen I describe the wise precautions I took for the\nconcealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked\nhastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I\ncut off the head and the arms and the legs.\nI then took up three planks from the flooring of the\nchamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then\nreplaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human\neye—not even his—could have detected any thing wrong.\nThere was nothing to wash out—no stain of any kind—no\nblood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had\ncaught all—ha! ha!\nWhen I had made an end of these labors, it was four\no’clock—still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the\nhour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down\nto open it with a light heart,—for what had I now to fear?\nThere entered three men, who introduced themselves, with\nperfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been\nheard by a neighbor during the night; suspicion of foul play\nhad been aroused; information had been lodged at the police\noffice, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the\npremises.\nI smiled,—for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen\nwelcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The\nold man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my\nvisitors all over the house. I bade them search—search well.\nI led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his\ntreasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my\nconfidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them\nhere to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild\naudacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the\nvery spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.\nThe officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced\nthem. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I\n\n8 THE TELL-TALE HEART\nanswered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But, ere\nlong, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My\nhead ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they\nsat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct:—it\ncontinued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to\nget rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained\ndefinitiveness—until, at length, I found that the noise was\nnot within my ears.\nNo doubt I now grew very pale;—but I talked more\nfluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound\nincreased—and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick\nsound—much such a sound as a watch makes when\nenveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath—and yet the officers\nheard it not. I talked more quickly—more vehemently; but\nthe noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles,\nin a high key and with violent gesticulations, but the noise\nsteadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the\nfloor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by\nthe observation of the men—but the noise steadily increased.\nOh God! what could I do? I foamed—I raved—I swore! I\nswung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it\nupon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually\nincreased. It grew louder—louder—louder! And still the\nmen chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they\nheard not? Almighty God!—no, no! They heard!—they\nsuspected!—they knew!—they were making a mockery of\nmy horror!—this I thought, and this I think. But any thing\nwas better than this agony! Any thing was more tolerable\nthan this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no\nlonger! I felt that I must scream or die!—and now—again!—\nhark! louder! louder! louder! louder!—\n“Villains!” I shrieked, “dissemble no more! I admit the\ndeed!—tear up the planks!—here, here!—it is the beating of\nhis hideous heart!”",
