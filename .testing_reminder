# Testing Methodology Reminder

⚠️ CRITICAL: All feature testing MUST follow browser-based UI testing methodology.

See TESTING_METHODOLOGY.md for complete workflow.

Quick checklist:
- [ ] Start API server and frontend
- [ ] Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in browser
- [ ] Execute command/feature in actual UI
- [ ] Verify results appear correctly
- [ ] Check for proper error messages (never "Unknown error")
- [ ] Use browser automation tools
- [ ] Document results with snapshots
- [ ] Clean up test servers

Never skip browser testing!
