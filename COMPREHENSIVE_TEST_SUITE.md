# Comprehensive Multi-Step Test Suite
## System-Wide Quality Assurance

**Date**: 2025-11-10
**System**: Auto Mac Agentic Framework
**Total Agents**: 24
**Total Tools**: 82
**Complexity Benchmark**: NVIDIA stock → report → PDF → zip → email (5-step flow)

## Test Design Philosophy

Based on your working NVIDIA example, I'm designing test cases that:
1. **Require 3-7 steps** (similar complexity to your benchmark)
2. **Cross multiple agents** (tests orchestration)
3. **Involve planning and disambiguation** (tests intelligence)
4. **Have clear success/failure criteria** (tests reliability)
5. **Cover all major agent categories** (tests completeness)
