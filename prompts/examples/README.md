# Few-Shot Example Library

This directory contains agent-scoped few-shot examples extracted from the legacy `prompts/few_shot_examples.md`.

- **core**: universal planning rules, capability checks, and guardrails
- **general**: cross-agent orchestration patterns used by the planner
- **file**, **writing**, **stocks**, **screen**, **maps**, **email**: domain-specific exemplars
- **cross_domain**, **web**, **safety**: specialized or guardrail scenarios

The file ordering within each folder preserves the sequence from the original prompt to maintain narrative context.

The auto-generated `index.json` maps each category to its constituent markdown files.
